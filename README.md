# About the project

This is the code I wrote following the Classed tutorial on building a social network using React, Node & Firebase and is based on the SocialApe app ([back end repository](https://github.com/hidjou/classsed-react-firebase-functions), [front end repository](https://github.com/hidjou/classsed-react-firebase-client)) from the [Classed Full Stack React & Firebase tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkBfu-W7tt0&list=PLMhAeHCz8S38ryyeMiBPPUnFAiWnoPvWP) by [Ahmed Hadjou](https://github.com/hidjou).

This code is for the front end. The back end code I wrote can be found [here](https://github.com/Kgotso-Koete/socialApe-functions).
